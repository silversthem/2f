# 2f
2f is a framework built on top of [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/), it provides :
  - [x] An event machine, to handle events (keyboard and mouse actions, for example) at little more nicely than with a giant while loop.
  - [x] Frames, which are an extention of `sf::RenderWindow`, handling objects displaying, physical calculations (collisions, mostly) and "ticking".
  - [ ] Timers and tickers, which call functions or methods when a certain amount of time has passed ( = ticks).
  - [x] Objects, the stuff you have in your plan, handling collision, events and movements (if needed).
  - [ ] Structures, which are 2D composite objects, like a house or a plateform (Pathfinding is supported natively and can be overwritten to apply contraints to the pathfinding algorithm).
  - [ ] Most geometrical calculations are included as well, and with movement class and its derivatives, following an object (or the mouse, or else), becomes a matter of a single instruction (even with pathfinding).
